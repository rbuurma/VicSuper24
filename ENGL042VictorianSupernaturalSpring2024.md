The nineteenth-century ghost story, weird tale, and horror novel let Victorian writers escape the strictures of realism to express new perspectives on questions of class, gender, sexuality, science and technology, empire, race, psychology, and religion. Supernatural topics allowed writers to experiment with narrative forms, inhabit non-human perspectives, imagine new technologies (automatic writing, telecommunications), question social norms, and test alternative ways of knowing. We will read works by both canonical and less-known authors and explore journalistic and scientific investigations into supernatural phenomena and spiritualist practices like ghost hunting, seances, and telepathy. No prerequisites. Fulfills the 18th/19th c requirement for English majors.

#### Writing platforms: Google Docs and Dropbox
We will use **Google Docs** for turning in assignments, **Dropbox** for sharing pdfs of readings, and **Zotero** for sometimes sharing research. All pdfs in Dropbox have been checked for accessiblity, but if you run into trouble using a particular document please let me know asap! I will give you detailed instructions for setting up your writing portfolio folder will and naming your documents in class and on the written assignments.

#### Writing Tools + AI
If we are going to use large language model-based writing generation for class assignments, each of you will receive an email with a link to set up your Swarthmore OpenAI account, which we will use in specific ways for some of our writing projects this semester. I will specify if, when, and how I would like you to use the Chat-GPT interface and other large language model-based tools in our writing assignments. In general, we will avoid using language these tools generate in our own writing, focusing instead on using them for brainstorming, outlining, and revision strategies. If you do use any for of automated writing genreation or any other AI-assisted writing tools to produce any of your writing for this class, please make sure to document what portions of text are AI-generated as you would document and cite any other text you include within a piece of writing you turn in.

### Policies and Advice

#### Grading
+ 20% in-class participation and reading journal
+ 30% 3 short research assignments
+ 20% short midterm essay
+ 30% final paper/project

#### Laptops and phones
This policy is constantly in flux for me across courses and semesters, but this year in this class I am going to ask that you do not use a laptop, tablet, or phone for note-taking during class time unless we specifically need one for our class activities. We may change this policy over the course of the semester. If you are a hardcore computer note-taker come discuss your strategy for preventing your computer from distracting you and I may make an exception. I’ll also ask that you silence and put away your mobile phone for the duration of class. Disability accommodations requiring the use of a computer or other device are of course an exception.

#### Attendance and due dates
Because this is a discussion-oriented class, attendance is essential. Missing more than two class sessions will result in a lowered grade (1/3 of a grade per additional unexcused absence) unless you have a valid excuse confirmed by your advisor or class dean. Late papers work the same way. Each of you has *two* single-use three-day-late passes for final/revised writing assignments; note that you have used it on the paper or assignment when you turn it in; no need to contact me about it. After that and on other assignments, you will incur a penalty (1/3 of a grade per three days late) unless you have a similarly valid excuse. So if a paper is due on Friday midnight and you don’t turn it in until the following Thursday evening, that’s 2/3 of a grade late, making an actual B+ paper, for example, into a recorded B-. First drafts must be on time because in general they will be due Monday and workshopped Wednesday-Friday.

If you have symptoms of COVID or any other contagious illness, please DO NOT come to class and follow the College's COVID protocols!

#### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. See the English department’s guidelines on how to properly cite sources here:

#### English major/minor requirement
This course fulfills the 18th/19th century requirement for the English major and minor.

#### Accommodations
I want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn most effectively. You are always free to talk to me about your own situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here:

> If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, please contact Student Disability Services via email at studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, the office will issue students with documented disabilities or medical conditions a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations process, visit the Student Disability Services website. You are also welcome to contact me privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.


#### Dean's Discretionary Fund and Dean's Office resources for basic needs

If, after exhausting the TAP resources, purchasing your textbooks or other materials for this or any other class present a serious financial difficulty for you, you should be aware of the [Dean's Discretionary Fund](http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-life/deans-discretionary-funding-request-guidelines) and other resources such as the Course Book Collection in Underhill Library in Lang Music.

The Dean's Office describes the fund this way:

> The spirit of this funding is primarily to support emergency circumstances and priority is given to students in the highest financial need tiers.  Funding is usually limited to under $500 and most grants are under $300.  Please note the Dean's Office may not be able to fulfill all requests.

> Examples of eligible non-academic requests include, but are not limited to, expenses associated with emergency medical, dental, vision procedures, unanticipated trips home due to a family emergency, and various fees related to postgraduate opportunities.

The Student Life office at Swarthmore is very committed to making sure that all students having living situations that support their ability to work and live here successfully. If you find that you are having sustained difficulties with your food or housing situation and believe that this may affect your course performance, you should contact your class dean; you are also free to contact me if you wish so that I can help you find the support you need.

If you have trouble accessing the Discretionary Fund or other resources in the Dean's Office, please feel free to come speak with me so that I can help.
